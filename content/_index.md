      Lunar is a macOS app that brings adaptive brightness to your external monitors.

      It uses the [DDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel) communication protocol to set the brightness and contrast of the monitor based on the ambient light, location or simply by using hotkeys.

      This is an Alexa skill for controlling Spotify through Noiseblend.

      It adds some of Noiseblend's features like:
      * Create Radio stations from up to 3 artists/tracks/genres
      * Get new recommendations and play them with a single command: _"Ask Noiseblend to play something"_
      * Fade the music up or down for `x` minutes
      * Start a sleep timer that fades the volume down gradually
      * Play Blends like *Immersive Reading* or *Romantic Night*
