      Lunar is a macOS app that brings adaptive brightness to your external monitors.

      It uses the [DDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel) communication protocol to set the brightness and contrast of the monitor based on the ambient light, location, external sensors or simply by using hotkeys.

      It can also adjust the monitor volume, switch to a different input or turn off the monitor.

      Noiseblend is a web app for discovering music on Spotify based on your listening history.

      It gives you an interface to the lesser known Spotify features like multiple-artist radio, genre playlists refreshed weekly and tuneable attributes like Acousticness or Danceability.
