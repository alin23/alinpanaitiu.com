      description: 
        Selecting words to view their definition is a very useful feature of Kindle devices. Although, that only works if you have a dictionary for the language of the book you're reading. 


        Because I couldn't find a Kindle dictionary for the Romanian language, I made one by extracting the [DEX Online](https://wiki.dexonline.ro/wiki/Instrucțiuni_de_instalare#Descărcați_baza_de_date) database and running it through [dex2xml](https://github.com/alin23/dex2xml).


        To use it, download the `DEX.mobi` file using the link below and copy it into the `documents/dictionaries/` directory on your Kindle device using USB.
